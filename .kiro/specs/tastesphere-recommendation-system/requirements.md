# Requirements Document

## Introduction

TasteSphere is a fully responsive React + Tailwind CSS frontend application that provides personalized recommendations across multiple content types (movies, music, books, destinations, etc.) through natural language interaction. The system leverages the Gemini LLM for entity extraction and natural language understanding, combined with the Qloo API for generating high-quality recommendations. The application features a modern chat-style interface with real-time AI responses, visual recommendation cards, filtering capabilities, and comprehensive debugging tools.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to input natural language descriptions of my interests so that I can receive personalized recommendations without having to navigate complex forms or categories.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user types natural language input (e.g., "I love sci-fi movies and indie music") THEN the system SHALL accept and process the input through a chat-style interface
2. WHEN the input is submitted THEN the system SHALL display the user's message in the chat container with appropriate styling
3. WHEN processing begins THEN the system SHALL show loading indicators to provide feedback to the user
4. IF the input is empty or invalid THEN the system SHALL display appropriate validation messages
5. WHEN the user presses Enter or clicks submit THEN the system SHALL trigger the recommendation flow

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to understand and extract relevant entities from my natural language input so that recommendations are accurately targeted to my interests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN natural language input is received THEN the system SHALL use Gemini LLM to extract entity types (movie, artist, book, destination, etc.) and interest topics
2. WHEN entity extraction is complete THEN the system SHALL identify and categorize each entity with its corresponding type
3. WHEN entities are extracted THEN the system SHALL display the parsed analysis in a debug panel for transparency
4. IF entity extraction fails THEN the system SHALL provide fallback handling and error messages
5. WHEN multiple entities are found THEN the system SHALL process all identified entities for recommendations

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see AI-generated responses in a conversational format so that the interaction feels natural and engaging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system processes user input THEN it SHALL display AI responses in a chat-style interface with distinct styling from user messages
2. WHEN generating responses THEN the system SHALL show typing indicators or loading states
3. WHEN responses are ready THEN they SHALL appear with smooth animations and transitions
4. WHEN multiple recommendations are available THEN the system SHALL organize them in a clear, conversational manner
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display helpful error messages in the chat flow

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see recommendation results displayed as visually appealing cards so that I can easily browse and evaluate the suggestions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN recommendations are fetched from Qloo API THEN the system SHALL display them as visually appealing cards
2. WHEN displaying cards THEN each SHALL include entity name, type, and available metadata
3. WHEN images are not available THEN the system SHALL use appropriate placeholder images
4. WHEN cards are rendered THEN they SHALL have consistent styling with soft shadows, rounded corners, and hover effects
5. WHEN multiple recommendations exist THEN they SHALL be organized in a responsive grid layout

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to filter recommendations by entity type so that I can focus on specific categories of interest.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN recommendations contain multiple entity types THEN the system SHALL display filter chips for each type (movie, book, destination, etc.)
2. WHEN a user clicks a filter chip THEN the system SHALL toggle the visibility of that entity type
3. WHEN filters are active THEN the system SHALL visually indicate which filters are enabled
4. WHEN all filters are disabled THEN the system SHALL show all recommendations
5. WHEN filter state changes THEN the system SHALL animate the transition smoothly

4. WHEN touch interactions are used THEN they SHALL work properly on mobile devices
5. WHEN the application is used across different screen sizes THEN all functionality SHALL remain accessible

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want smooth animations and modern UI elements so that the application feels polished and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN UI elements appear or change THEN they SHALL use smooth transitions and animations

4. WHEN dark mode is toggled THEN the transition SHALL be smooth and all elements SHALL adapt properly
5. WHEN cards or components are hovered THEN they SHALL provide subtle interactive feedback

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want to control the conversation flow so that I can start fresh or regenerate results when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

4. WHEN "Clear Chat" is clicked THEN the system SHALL remove all messages and reset all state
5. WHEN control buttons are used THEN they SHALL be easily accessible and clearly labeled

### Requirement 9
